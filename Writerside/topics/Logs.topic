            <td>I completed a set of 49 problems on systems of linear equations in several variables. The key takeaway from this exercise was the recognition of the importance of documenting each step in the solution process. I identified certain inefficient habits, such as the omission of steps and inaccurate mental calculations, which contributed to errors. The methodical approach has proven effective in mitigating such errors.</td>

            <td>I'm finding the memorization of all the concepts in Chapter 10 quite difficult. I know that consistent practice is the most effective way to improve my understanding. For the time being, my answers in the Concept Check section are primarily phrases and keywords as I continue to work on memorization and strengthen my English language skills.</td>
