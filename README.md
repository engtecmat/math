## Fundamentals

### Complex Numbers

**DEFINITION OF COMPLEX NUMBERS**

A **complex** number is an expression of the form
$$a + bi$$
where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i^2 = -1$. The **real part** of the complex number is a, and the **imaginary part** is $b$. Two complex numbers are equal if and only their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal.

**ADDING, SUBTRACTING, AND MULTIPLYING COMPLEX NUMBERS**

| Definition                                                              | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Addition** <br/> $(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b+d)i$             | To add complex numbers, add the real parts and the imaginary parts.           |
| **Subtraction** <br/> $(a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i$        | To subtract complex numbers, subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts. |
| **Multiplication** <br/> $(a + bi) * (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i$ | Multiply complex numbers like binomials, using i^2 = -1.                      |
**DIVIDING COMPLEX NUMBERS**

To simplify the quotient $\frac{a + bi} {c + di}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:
$$\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \left(\frac{a + bi}{c + di}\right)\left(\frac{c - di}{c - di}\right) = \frac{(ac + bd)(bc-ad)i}{c^2 + d^2}$$

**SQUARE ROOTS OF NEGATIVE NUMBERS**

If $-r$ is negative, then the **principal square root** of $-r$ is
$$\sqrt{-r} = i\sqrt{r}$$
The two square roots of $-r$ are $i\sqrt{r}$ and $-i\sqrt{r}$.
###  Modeling with Equations

**GUIDELINES FOR MODELING WITH EQUATIONS**

1. **Identify the Variable.** Identify the quantity that problem asks you to find. This quantity can usually be determined by **a careful reading of the question** that is posed at the end of the problem. Then **introduce notation** for the variable (call it x or some other letter).
2. **Translate from Words to Algebra.** Read each sentence in the problem again, and express all the quantities mentioned in the problem in terms of the variable you defined in Sept 1. To organize this information, it is sometimes helpful to **draw a diagram** or **make a table**.
3. **Set Up the Model.** Find the crucial fact in the problem that gives a relationship between the expressions you listed in Step 2. **Set up an equation** (or **model**) that expresses this relationship.
4. **Solve the Equation and Check Your Answer.** Solve the equation, check your answer, and express it as a sentence that answers the question posed in the problem.

**Explain an Equation**

When an equation models a real-world situation, it means that the equation represents  a relationship between quantities in that situation. The equation uses mathematical symbols and variables to describe how those quantities are related. Solving the equation can help use understand or predict the behavior of the real-world system.

Example:

Let's say you're running a lemonade stand. You know that each glass of lemonade costs you $0.50 to make, and you sell each glass for $1.50. You want to figure out how many glasses of lemonade you need to sell to make a profit of $20.

You can model this situation with equation:

`Profit = (Selling price per glass - Cost per glass) * Number of glasses sold`

Substituting the values:

`$20 = ($1.50 - $0.50) * Number of glasses sold`

Solve for **the number of glasses sold** gives you the answer to your real-world problem.

Key points to emphasize:

- Equations are tools to represent and solve real-world problems.
- They can involve multiple variable.
- Solving an equation may not always directly give the final answer to the problem.
### Inequalities

| 4. If $C < 0$, then $A \leq B \Leftrightarrow CA \geq CB$                                | **Multiplying** each side of an inequality by the same *negative* quantity *reverses the direction* of the inequality.           |

| 6. If $A \leq B$ and $C \leq D$, then $A + C \leq B + D$                                 | Inequalities can be added.                                                                                                       |
| 7. If $A \leq B$ and $B \leq C$, then $A \leq C$                                         | Inequality is transitive.                                                                                                        |
